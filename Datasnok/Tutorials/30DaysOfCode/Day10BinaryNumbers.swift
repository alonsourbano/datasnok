Objective
Today, we're working with binary numbers. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task
Given a base- integer, , convert it to binary (base-). Then find and print the base- integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 's in 's binary representation.

Input Format

A single integer, .

Constraints


Output Format

Print a single base- integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 's in the binary representation of .

Sample Input 1

5
Sample Output 1

1
Sample Input 2

13
Sample Output 2

2
Explanation

Sample Case 1:
The binary representation of  is , so the maximum number of consecutive 's is .

Sample Case 2:
The binary representation of  is , so the maximum number of consecutive 's is .
